# Sports Analytics Portfolio — Sanjit Saji

This portfolio showcases my data science work in **cricket analytics** and **American football analytics**.  
All projects include real datasets, reproducible code, and professional reports.

##  Featured Projects

### 1. IPL Tournament Simulation with Bradley–Terry Modeling  
**Folder:** `cricket/ipl-bradley-terry-tournament-simulation/`
**Live HTML Report:** https://sanjit2004.github.io/sports-analytics-portfolio/ipl-bradley-terry-tournament-simulation.html
This project fits a Bradley–Terry paired comparison model to the **2019 IPL season** and simulates **20,000 seasons** to estimate finalist probabilities.  
The analysis quantifies tournament volatility and models the probability of MI and CSK reaching the final together.

Includes:  
- Bradley–Terry estimation  
- Home/away + batting-first effects  
- Season-level simulation  
- Probability of finalist pairs  
- Professional PDF + HTML reports


### 2. IPL Win Probability Model (Ball-by-Ball)  
**Folder:** `cricket/ipl-win-probability-model/` 
**Live HTML Report:** https://Sanjit2004.github.io/sports-analytics-portfolio/ipl-win-probability.html  
A ball-by-ball win probability model that evaluates how match momentum shifts during an IPL game using logistic/state-based modeling.

Includes:  
- Feature engineering from ball-by-ball data  
- Win probability calculation  
- Match visualizations  
- Turning-point detection

### 3. High School Football Production Metrics  
**Folder:** `football/hs-production-metrics/`  
A full pipeline to scrape high school football stats, clean the data, and derive production metrics.

Includes:  
- Web scraping (Python)  
- Data cleaning & unification  
- Rank-based performance metrics  
- Exploratory plots and trends

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, R 
**Python:** pandas, numpy  
**R:** tidyverse, ggplot2, BradleyTerry2, rmarkdown  
**Tools:** RStudio, Git, GitHub
